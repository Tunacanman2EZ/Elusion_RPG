# gameconstants.gd — game-wide tuning constants in one place for easy balancing.
# registered as an autoload singleton (named GameConstants), so any script
# reads e.g. GameConstants.REVIVE_COST without importing anything.
#
# put numbers here that (a) are referenced in more than one place, or
# (b) you'll want to tune during balancing without hunting through scripts.
